# Lung-Cancer-Exploratory-Analysis
-This project leverages SQL and Power BI to conduct exploratory data analysis on a dataset containing primarily binary data. The dataset includes various attributes related to health and lifestyle factors, such as smoking habits, symptoms, and chronic conditions.
-The main objective of this project is to derive meaningful insights from the dataset using SQL queries and visualizations created in Power BI. By analyzing the relationships between different variables, the project aims to uncover patterns and correlations that can provide valuable insights into factors associated with lung cancer risk.

Key Features:

-Data Analysis with SQL: Utilizes SQL queries to aggregate and analyze binary data attributes such as smoking habits, symptoms, and health conditions.
-Risk Score Calculation: Introduces a custom Risk Score metric that was not part of the original dataset. This Risk Score is calculated based on various health and lifestyle factors to quantify the risk of lung cancer.
-Interactive Visualizations in Power BI: Implements Power BI for data visualization to create interactive dashboards and reports.
-Correlation Analysis: Investigates correlations between different variables, including the newly introduced Risk Score, to identify potential risk factors associated with lung cancer.
-Insightful Presentations: Presents findings through clear and informative visualizations to facilitate understanding and decision-making.

Conclusion:
Through this project, I have demonstrated proficiency in SQL for data manipulation and aggregation, as well as in Power BI for creating insightful visualizations. The addition of a custom Risk Score provides a quantifiable measure of lung cancer risk, enhancing the analysis. The insights gained contribute to a better understanding of the dataset and provide a basis for further research or decision-making in healthcare analytics.
